# Backchanneling Toolkit

This is a toolkit for authoring robot backchanneling behaviors in a block-based programming manner, for the VStone Sota robot.
This application is part of a master's thesis project on exposing rich dialog behaviors (backchanneling) to non-expert end users of robot behavior authoring tools.

## Components

This project consists of a client, server, and a robot application.

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Client | NodeJS web-based application built with Google Blockly |
| Server | Stateful Python server and APIs for communicating between client and robot |
| Robot | Java application run on a VStone Sota (Edison edition) robot |

## Usage

### Running the code

This is a stub. Eventually, I'll have a nifty tool to spin everything up at once... right?

### Development

This is another stub. Write important dev-related notes in here for future contributors.
